# Matching Validation Assets

This folder contains scripts/files related to place matching validation.

Important:
- These assets are not for open/closed prediction.
- In this matching dataset, `label=1` means "match" and `label=0` means "no match".
- Do not use these labels as `open`/`closed` targets.
